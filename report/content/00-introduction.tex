\chapter{Introduction}

The process of water treatment involves the elimination of any biological,
chemical, or physical elements that could potentially endanger the safety of the
water supply intended for human and household consumption.

The process aids in generating water that is free from harmful substances,
pleasant-tasting, transparent, lacking in color and smell, and also
non-corrosive so as not to harm pipelines. \cite{TheConstructor}
